# **🌟 SanOS**

**Advanced Browser-Based Operating System Platform**

SanOS is a production-grade Progressive Web Application (PWA) that simulates a complete desktop operating system entirely within your web browser. Built with a stunning glass-morphism UI inspired by macOS, Windows 11, and Material You, it offers a fully functional, persistent workspace without requiring any actual software installation.

## **🛠️ Tech Stack**
